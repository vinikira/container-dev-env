Container development environment

* Description
An attempt to build dynamic developer environments using
containerd. Work in progress.

* Getting Started
** Edit files
Edit the first line of the =Dockerfile.dev= file with the choosen
programming language container. Alpine containers isn't supported
yet. Example:

#+begin_src dockerfile
FROM elixir:1.13-slim
#+end_src

On the Makefile, edit the section with =CONTAINER_APP= and =COMPOSE_APP=
with the choosen container manager, by default is nerdctl +
lima. Example:

#+begin_src makefile
  CONTAINER_APP = nerdctl.lima
  COMPOSE_APP := $(CONTAINER_APP) compose
#+end_src

** Up environment
Up the environment with:

#+begin_src sh
  make up
#+end_src

List the containers up with:

#+begin_src sh
  make ps
#+end_src

Get into shell your envinroment with:

#+begin_src sh
  make run <CONTAINER_NAME> /bin/bash
#+end_src

The current directory is mapped as a volume by default and all
artifacts created/changed will be owned by the current user's host.
